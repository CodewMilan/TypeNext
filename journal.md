# 🔧 Keyverse48 — Build Notes & Progress

Welcome to the behind-the-scenes log of **Keyverse**, my DIY journey into building a no-nonsense, clean, and modular mechanical keyboard. This is *not* your typical RGB bling keyboard. I’m going for minimal, functional, and **custom from start to finish**.

## 🗓️ May 21 — Kickoff: Learning & Schematics

Decided to dive deep into custom mechanical keyboards. Binge-watched a few build logs and tutorials on YouTube, went through QMK’s documentation, and got a decent understanding of how everything ties together.

Since I had prior experience with EasyEDA, I quickly moved on to making the schematic. Here's a shot from that phase:

💡 Fun discovery today: Found out **Type-C Pro Micros exist** (finally, USB-C supremacy).

Goal for this keyboard = **clean**, **compact**, no gimmicks, **strictly no RGB**. Just satisfying clicks and a good layout.

PCB done ✔ — exactly how I wanted it.

## 🗓️ May 22 — Case Design: Minimal Is Everything

3D model for the case completed today.

Kept it **simple** and **clean**. Focused more on practicality than looks, but it still came out nice.

The STL files are already in the repo for anyone who wants to remix or print their own version.

## 🗓️ June 7 — Optimizing the BOM 📝

Today was all about hunting for parts and **optimizing cost**. Cross-checked component prices across Robu, AliExpress, and JLCPCB to make sure no part blows the budget.

Updated the BOM with fresh links and better estimates. Also verified that all parts align with the final PCB version — didn’t want to end up with mismatched footprints later.

Final call on **case material** is pending. Might go acrylic for the aesthetics + sturdiness, or stick to 3D printing for fast prototyping. Will decide after the build.

## ⚡ Next Steps
- Assembly & soldering
- Flash QMK
- Final case decision → Print or cut

More updates soon after I get my hands dirty with the hardware.

Stay tuned 🚀
