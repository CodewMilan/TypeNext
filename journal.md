**Hours spent: 2 hrs**  
Decided to go full send and build my own 60-key ortholinear keyboard PCB  
Started bingeing YouTube vids on keyboard PCB design cuz I had no clue  
Learned about matrix wiring, diode flow (why is that a thing), and how to not fry a Pro Micro  
Installed KiCad, got overwhelmed, then started vibing with it  
Sketched the 5×12 layout on paper and ngl it looked kinda clean

Opened KiCad’s schematic editor and went to war  
Dropped in the ATmega32u4 and 60 diodes like a machine  
Wired up the row-column matrix, almost lost it halfway but survived  
Cross-checked with QMK docs like my life depended on it  
Cleaned up the mess and actually ended up with a decent schematic

Jumped into PCB layout and instantly felt pain  
Slapped down Kailh hotswap sockets in a perfect grid  
Routed traces like it was a puzzle game on hard mode  
Fixed DRC errors, shifted things like 100 times  
Added USB-C Pro Micro footprint and called it a win

Did some silkscreen drip with Keyverse 60 and Highway Series labels  
Added test points for vibes and future-proofing  
Exported the Gerber files like a pro  
Threw it into EasyEDA to make ordering smooth  
dropped it in the Highway Form just to flex a little

Designed a new case with proper screw holes and USB cutout
